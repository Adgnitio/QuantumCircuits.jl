# 1 Introduction
We would like to implement a single trotter step of ùëãùëãùëã Heisenberg Spin Model uses as less gates as this is possible to reduce the noises and errors real quantum device. The ùëãùëãùëã Heisenberg Hamiltonian $H_\text{Heis}$ as defined below:
```math
\begin{equation}
H_{\text{Heis}} = \sum_{\langle ij \rangle}^{N} J \left(\sigma_x^{(i)}\sigma_x^{(j)} + \sigma_y^{(i)}\sigma_y^{(j)} + \sigma_z^{(i)}\sigma_z^{(j)}\right).
\end{equation}
```

$N$ is the number of spin-1/2 particles in model. The operators $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\sigma_z$ are [Pauli operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices) where the $i$ and $j$ superscripts label which qubit they act on. For example, $\sigma_x^{(1)}$ would be the $\sigma_x$ operator acting on only qubit 1 (which is the 2nd qubit since indexing starts at 0). This version of the general Heisenberg spin model is called $XXX$ because the same $J$ value multiplies each pair of Pauli operators. The sum notation $\langle ij \rangle$ means the sum is over nearest neighbors (only qubits next to each other interact), and $J$ is the interaction strength, which we will set $J=1$.

In our example we use the quantum system of 3 spin-1/2 particles.
```math
H_{\text{Heis3}} = \sigma_x^{(0)}\sigma_x^{(1)} + \sigma_x^{(1)}\sigma_x^{(2)} + \sigma_y^{(0)}\sigma_y^{(1)} + \sigma_y^{(1)}\sigma_y^{(2)} + \sigma_z^{(0)}\sigma_z^{(1)} + \sigma_z^{(1)}\sigma_z^{(2)}.
```

### 1-3 Time Evolution
Knowing the Hamiltonian, we can determine how quantum states of that system evolve in time by solving the [Schr√∂dinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr√∂dinger_equation)
```math
i\hbar \dfrac{d}{dt}|\psi(t)\rangle = H |\psi(t)\rangle
```

For simplicity, let's set $\hbar = 1$. We know that the Hamiltonian $H_{\text{heis3}}$ does not change in time, so the solution to the Schr√∂dinger equation is an exponential of the Hamiltonian operator
```math
\begin{align}
U_{\text{Heis3}}(t) &= e^{-it H_\text{Heis3}} = \exp\left(-it H_\text{Heis3}\right) \\
U_{\text{Heis3}}(t) &= \exp\left[-it \sum_{\langle ij \rangle}^{N=3} \left(\sigma_x^{(i)}\sigma_x^{(j)} + \sigma_y^{(i)}\sigma_y^{(j)} + \sigma_z^{(i)}\sigma_z^{(j)}\right) \right] \\
U_{\text{Heis3}}(t) &= \exp\left[-it \left(\sigma_x^{(0)}\sigma_x^{(1)} + \sigma_x^{(1)}\sigma_x^{(2)} + \sigma_y^{(0)}\sigma_y^{(1)} + \sigma_y^{(1)}\sigma_y^{(2)} + \sigma_z^{(0)}\sigma_z^{(1)} + \sigma_z^{(1)}\sigma_z^{(2)}\right) \right]
\end{align}
```

Now that we have the time evolution operator $U_{\text{Heis3}}(t)$, we can simulate changes in a state of the system ($|\psi(t)\rangle$) over time $|\psi(t)\rangle = U_{\text{Heis3}}(t)|\psi(t=0)\rangle$. 

### 1-5 Decomposition of $U_{\text{Heis3}}(t)$ Into Quantum Gates

To execute $U_{\text{Heis3}}(t)$ on a circuit model [Quantum Circuit](@ref) quantum computer, we must decompose $U_{\text{Heis3}}(t)$ into a product of single and two-qubit gates that are native to that quantum computer. There are a [variety of techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_simulation) to do this. For this Open Science Prize, you will only use [Trotterization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_simulation#Product_Formulas) (which is sometimes refered to as Suzuki-Trotterization decomposition, Trotter formulas, product formulas, and other names).

Below, we show an example Trotterization as outlined in \[1-2\].

Since the [Pauli operators do not commute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices#Commutation_relations) with each other, the exponential $U_{\text{Heis3}}(t)$ cannot be split into a product of simpler exponentials. However, we can approximate $U_{\text{Heis3}}(t)$ as a product of simpler exponentials through Trotterization. Consider a subsystem of 2 spin-1/2 particles within the larger 3 spin system. The Hamiltonian on spins $i$ and $j$ ($i,j \in \{0,1,2\}$) would be $H^{(i,j)}_{\text{Heis2}} = \sigma_x^{(i)}\sigma_x^{(j)} + \sigma_y^{(i)}\sigma_y^{(j)} + \sigma_z^{(i)}\sigma_z^{(j)}$. Rewritting $U_{\text{Heis3}}(t)$ in terms of the two possible subsystems within the total $N=3$ system you will simulate,

```math
U_{\text{Heis3}}(t) = \exp\left[-i t \left(H^{(0,1)}_{\text{Heis2}} + H^{(1,2)}_{\text{Heis2}} \right)\right].
```

$H^{(0,1)}_{\text{Heis2}}$ and $H^{(1,2)}_{\text{Heis2}}$ do not commute, so $U_{\text{Heis3}}(t) \neq \exp\left(-i t H^{(0,1)}_{\text{Heis2}}\right) \exp\left(-i t H^{(1,2)}_{\text{Heis2}} \right)$. But, this product decomposition can be approximated with Trotterization which says $U_{\text{Heis3}}(t)$ is approximately a short evolution of $H^{(0,1)}_{\text{Heis2}}$ (time = $t/n$) and followed by a short evolution of $H^{(1,2)}_{\text{Heis2}}$ (time = $t/n$) repeated $n$ times

```math
\begin{align}
U_{\text{Heis3}}(t) &= \exp\left[-i t \left(H^{(0,1)}_{\text{Heis2}} + H^{(1,2)}_{\text{Heis2}} \right)\right] \\
U_{\text{Heis3}}(t) &\approx \left[\exp\left(\dfrac{-it}{n}H^{(0,1)}_{\text{Heis2}}\right) \exp\left(\dfrac{-it}{n}H^{(1,2)}_{\text{Heis2}} \right)\right]^n.
\end{align}
```

n is the number of Trotter steps, and as $n$ increases, the approximation becomes more accurate. (Note that how a untiary is split up into subsystems for Trotterization is not necessarily unique.) The decomposition goes further. Within each 2 spin subsystems, the Pauli operator pairs ($\sigma_x^{(i)}\sigma_x^{(j)}$, $\sigma_y^{(i)}\sigma_y^{(j)}$, and $\sigma_z^{(i)}\sigma_z^{(j)}$) commute. This means we can decompose the exponential of a subsystem Hamiltonian ($H^{(i,j)}_{\text{Heis2}}$) into a product of even simpler exponentials getting us closer to a gate implementation of $U_{\text{Heis3}}(t)$

```math
\begin{align}
U_{\text{Heis3}}(t) &\approx \left[\exp\left(\dfrac{-it}{n}H^{(0,1)}_{\text{Heis2}}\right) \exp\left(\dfrac{-it}{n}H^{(1,2)}_{\text{Heis2}} \right)\right]^n \\
U_{\text{Heis3}}(t) &\approx \left[\exp\left(\dfrac{-it}{n}\left(\sigma_x^{(0)}\sigma_x^{(1)} + \sigma_y^{(0)}\sigma_y^{(1)} + \sigma_z^{(0)}\sigma_z^{(1)}\right)\right) \exp\left(\dfrac{-it}{n}\left(\sigma_x^{(1)}\sigma_x^{(2)} + \sigma_y^{(1)}\sigma_y^{(2)} + \sigma_z^{(1)}\sigma_z^{(2)}\right)\right)\right]^{n} \\
U_{\text{Heis3}}(t) &\approx \left[\exp\left(\dfrac{-it}{n}\sigma_x^{(0)}\sigma_x^{(1)}\right) \exp\left(\dfrac{-it}{n}\sigma_y^{(0)}\sigma_y^{(1)}\right) \exp\left(\dfrac{-it}{n}\sigma_z^{(0)}\sigma_z^{(1)}\right) \exp\left(\dfrac{-it}{n}\sigma_x^{(1)}\sigma_x^{(2)}\right) \exp\left(\dfrac{-it}{n}\sigma_y^{(1)}\sigma_y^{(2)}\right) \exp\left(\dfrac{-it}{n}\sigma_z^{(1)}\sigma_z^{(2)}\right)\right]^{n}
\end{align}
```

For simplicity, and to use more common notation, let's rename the products with $XX(2t) = \exp\left(-it \sigma_x\sigma_x\right)$, $YY(2t) = \exp\left(-it \sigma_y\sigma_y\right)$, and $ZZ(2t) = \exp\left(-it \sigma_z\sigma_z\right)$ and rewrite the Trotterized $U_{\text{Heis3}}(t)$
```math
U_{\text{Heis3}}(t) \approx \left[XX\left(\frac{2t}{n}\right)^{(0,1)} YY\left(\frac{2t}{n}\right)^{(0,1)} ZZ\left(\frac{2t}{n}\right)^{(0,1)} XX\left(\frac{2t}{n}\right)^{(1,2)} YY\left(\frac{2t}{n}\right)^{(1,2)} ZZ\left(\frac{2t}{n}\right)^{(1,2)} \right]^{n}
```
And that's it! We have now approximately decomposed $U_{\text{Heis3}}(t)$ into two-qubit gates $XX(t)$, $YY(t)$, and $ZZ(t)$. These gates are not native to superconducting qubits, but in Section 2, they will be further decomposed into native single and two-qubit gates with *further details found in the supplementary material.*
