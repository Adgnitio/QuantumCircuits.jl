QuantumCircuits is an open-source library for working with quantum computers at the application level, especially for Quantum Machine Learning and Quantum Finance.

Library QuantumCircuits contains the following modules:
* QCircuits - the module used to create quantum circuits, manipulate them and convert them to Qiskit if necessary.
* Execute - module to execute the quantum circuit on a Julia quantum simulator or on a real device using Qiskit.
* QML - Quantum Machine learning module which contains the optimization method and QML tools.
